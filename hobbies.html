    <p>I have many interests and hobbies. Some of them include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing music</li>
        <li>Snowboarding</li>
        <li>Biking</li>
        <li>Drum Corps</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Playing Music</h2>
    <p>I'm a drummer, so when I play music, I usually play the drums. I can also "play" piano and guitar. I have played in many 
        cover bands around the Houston area and am currently the drummer for a local band 
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/search?q=steal%20carmona" target='_blank'>Steal Carmona</a>. Below is a video of our last
        performance.

    <h2>Snowboarding</h2>
    <p>Snowboarding is a very fun way to dislocate your shoulder. Most of my family still lives in Colorado, so I like to
        strategically plan my visits during the winter. Below is a graceful representation of how not to snowboard.

    <br>
    <h2>Biking</h2>
    <p>Most of the biking I do is of the mountain variety. Oddly enough, there are no mountains around here, so maybe it's more trail biking. 
        Either way, there are some amazing trail systems all around Houston. My favorite is the Cypresswood Trail in Collins Park all the way up in Spring. 
        For info about all the trails around Houston, you can visit the <a href="http://ghorba.org/" target='_blank'>Greater Houston Off Road
        Biking Association's</a> website.

    <br>
    <h2>Drum Corps</h2>
    <p>When I was in high school, I played in the drumline in the high school band. From being involved in band, I was introduced to a summer long, extra-curricular
        band activity called Drum Corps. Basically, it's kind of like an advanced marching band comprised of mostly college age performers. Nerd alert! I was a member of the Blue Knights from Denver and 
        the Santa Clara Vanguard from Santa Clara, CA. Below is video from 2004 with Santa Clara Vanguard.

    <br>
    <p>When you turn 21, you "age out" of drum corps. After I aged out, I went on to teach the Bluecoats from Canton, OH and the Cavaliers from Rosemont, IL.

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>This is more of a former career and not a hobby, but I used to be a high school percussion teacher. Below is a video of one of the ensembles
        I taught.
